Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard


<!-- About -->
For this assignment I created a weather dashboard. When you search for a city
then you're presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. Also, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index will all be displayed on the dashboard. 
The UV index is represented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. When you click on a city in the search history then you'll once again be presented with current and future conditions for that city.
